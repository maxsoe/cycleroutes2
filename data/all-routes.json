Bag a place on this ride in France as soon as you can for a ticket to one of the best overseas one-day bike trips there is.  After meeting in Dover, we’ll provide you with your rider number on board the ferry and you’ll be free to begin pedalling as soon as we disembark on the other side of the English Channel. This event serves as a perfect introduction to riding on the Continent, offering participants a snapshot of rural France — the spiritual home of cycling.  Leaving Calais, you’ll follow the coastline westwards and, despite exposure to invariably blustery conditions, the views out over the channel will keep you buoyed for the remainder of the ride.  A series of quaint and quintessentially French towns and villages are passed — in between which lies a series of short and punchy climbs, joined by a network of small and narrow byways. Such is the width of these lanes you’ll find cars around here are decidedly absent but in the rare event of meeting one expect an encouraging “Allez!” from the drivers. This is, after all, France, where cycling is the national pastime.  Following a clockwise route around the Nord Pas de Calais department, the atmospheric rural areas here boast a charm exclusive to Northern France and will leave you with fond memories and no doubt a photo or two.  And now, as you approach the end of the route — buffeted about by headwinds as you rejoin the coastal roads — the grand finale lies in wait. Indeed, today’s most demanding appointment in Ecalles is positioned agonisingly close to the finish line. It’s tough but manageable — and summiting it leaves you with a sprint to the international port where we’ll get you on the next available ferry home for a well-deserved verre du vin.  If you've ever considered cycling in France, signing up to Le Classique Sportive is your chance to join hundreds of other cyclists on carefully selected routes, complete with mechanical and medical support, to enjoy the French countryside from the saddle. That and the fact your travel to and from France is all booked for you, what are you waiting for?",

These should serve as nice testers to get you warmed up for the final climb at Dunks Green, that ascends steadily for several miles before peaking at Sevenoaks Common. It is here that you’ll embark on a nice descent before re-joining the Standard riders once again.

    "description": "Taking its name from the typically flat lands in Lincolnshire and the surrounding area, you’ll glide through the level plains on the Sigma Sports' Arrow Sportive like a dart through the air – save for an unlikely uphill test that waits for tired legs at the end of the ride. You’ll start out on Market Rasen Racecourse and head south, straight onto quiet roads. The first part of the course points more downhill than the even gradient the area is famous for – so make the most of the slightly sloping angle as you pass through sleepy village after sleepy village, linked by unspoilt country lanes. Heading towards Lincoln, the first climb of the day will present itself just after Canwick. It’s steep but quick and easy to deal with after a little exertion.  Once this has passed, it’s onto the long, straight open roads as far south as Ruskington in the North Kesteven District – giving you through opportunity to set your own pace on terrain that remains relatively flat.  Crossing over a series of dykes and small rivers, you’ll head to Woodhall Spa and Bucknall, where the terrain slowly begins to rise, as you cling to the Lincolnshire Wolds for the next 15 miles until the finish line is in sight, from here it is a flat run in to Market Rasen.",

    "description": "The Wiggle New Forest Spring Sportive is one of our most popular event and has become a welcome start-of-season test for for many cyclists. Due to its popularity, the event runs on both a Saturday and Sunday – and usually sells out before the day. Take this as a sign that you’ll get your cycling fill from this sportive, which takes in much of the stunning New Forest on the route.  As you ride and take in the views in the rolling scenery, there will be a number of hills to challenge your legs – plus a test to come near the end – with short and sharp climbs popping up every now and again to keep you on your toes. Beautiful New Forest villages of Sway, Beaulieu and Lepe are passed through before you head north and back into the centre of the district.  Quickly in and out of central point Lyndhurst, you’ll soon take on the events major climb of the day, just outside Nomansland. It’s steep, but fairly short, so you should be able to dispose of this quickly and continue on your way. From here, it’s downhill all the way – with one spiky hill exception around Stuckton and the final feed stop – as you roll back around the edges of the Forest, towards Ringwood, and claim your medal, t-shirt and recovery product at the finish line.  Somerley House and Gardens are not usually open to the public; however as an added bonus, riders of the Wiggle New Forest Spring Sportive and supporters will have the chance to view some of the State rooms within the House and access to the Gardens on the event day.",

Quickly in and out of central point Lyndhurst, you’ll soon take on the events major climb of the day, just outside Nomansland. It’s steep, but fairly short, so you should be able to dispose of this quickly and continue on your way. From here, it’s downhill all the way – with one spiky hill exception around Stuckton and the final feed stop – as you roll back around the edges of the Forest, towards Ringwood, and claim your medal, t-shirt and recovery product at the finish line.

    "description": "The Wiggle Vale Velo is an early-season sportive designed to get you back into your best form and ready for the rest of the riding calendar, by taking you around the ever-popular cycling haven that is North Yorkshire.  The course allows you to chip away at the miles while tackling occasionally testing terrain. With almost 4,000ft of climbing over the Epic route, this is a quick and speedy course, presenting to you some of the best views the Vale of York and the Yorkshire Wolds have to offer, while also providing an early-year wake-up call for the legs.  Cycling in North Yorkshire  Starting from the York Auction Centre, the course heads straight out onto the roads of the stunning North Yorkshire district, while also threading through the quaint and typically pretty villages of the area. First, the route bears east, taking you past the historic battleground of Stamford Bridge, before heading up to Low Callis Wold.  At this point, riders of the Short course split off and head north to re-join the course at Leavening, while Epic and Standard riders continue east to pass through North Dalton, soon to take their own path north  Once again, the course splits shortly after, just before Sledmere House, sending Standard riders west as Epic riders continue to ride east even further, to the farthest point on the course in Rudston. Here, we start to head for home, and as the finish closes in, two final climbs lay in wait before the long, gradual descent back to York.  The Wiggle Vale Velo Sportive is ideal for those wanting to get some training in and, considering the distances, isn't too harsh on the legs. That said, there are a few nice and challenging climbs along the Epic route, so don't partake thinking it will be a ride in the park. It's not.

Not forgetting this ride’s challenging hills, this South Downs Sportive matches great climbs with the best descents that sprawl through stunning open country lanes.  Kicking off in pretty Plumpton, the route heads east on unassuming back roads that can be taken at speed if so desired. As much as the hills on this route are a welcome challenge, you’ll be out of your saddle and counting on every last bit of winter training you have for the toughest ascents.  Flirting with the most infamous hills in the area, riders are taken around the base of some fearsome climbs but the route tends to stick to luxurious rolling roads tucked away from traffic. Exploring East Sussex, sleepy villages are taken in one by one before reaching the outskirts of Heathfield – but this ride stays true to its countryside routes as it soon reaches back into the wilderness.  Taking in a loop out past Five Ashes and back past High Hurstwood, you’ll be taken past Buxted and towards Uckfield on roads that remain mostly flat, quiet and long ranging. The route then leads north before crossing back into Mid-Sussex and turning south just before it crosses the River Ouse. A shining sun and helpful tailwind are enough to push you along for one last boost towards the finish line – which finishes on a mostly downward slope.

    "description": "If you haven’t blown the winter cobwebs off your bike with a fast and free-flowing ride this far into the year, the Sigma Sports South Downs Spring Sportive, set amongst the stunning South Downs of Sussex, is likely just the event to ease you back into the saddle.  Not forgetting this ride’s challenging hills, this South Downs Sportive matches great climbs with the best descents that sprawl through stunning open country lanes.  Kicking off in pretty Plumpton, the route heads east on unassuming back roads that can be taken at speed if so desired. As much as the hills on this route are a welcome challenge, you’ll be out of your saddle and counting on every last bit of winter training you have for the toughest ascents.  Flirting with the most infamous hills in the area, riders are taken around the base of some fearsome climbs but the route tends to stick to luxurious rolling roads tucked away from traffic. Exploring East Sussex, sleepy villages are taken in one by one before reaching the outskirts of Heathfield – but this ride stays true to its countryside routes as it soon reaches back into the wilderness.  Taking in a loop out past Five Ashes and back past High Hurstwood, you’ll be taken past Buxted and towards Uckfield on roads that remain mostly flat, quiet and long ranging. The route then leads north before crossing back into Mid-Sussex and turning south just before it crosses the River Ouse. A shining sun and helpful tailwind are enough to push you along for one last boost towards the finish line – which finishes on a mostly downward slope. You’ll cross the finish line feeling enthralled.",

Much like a horse racing course, the route is filled with flat and consistent terrain, leaving no excuse for stragglers to be behind by the first hurdle. You’ll cross through Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Essex in this tri-county sportive, which begins by heading south, picking up the River Stour around Brinkley, which you’ll follow for a short while until reaching the outskirts of Haverhill. Taking in sleepy villages with their idyllic churches and greens typical of the area, you’ll press forward without the interruption from hills or climbing on this free-flowing ride. Entering into Essex for a few miles, you’ll pass through historic towns such as Thaxted, with its age-old buildings lining the High Street. Continuing on, it’s a simple case of chewing away the miles left to go as the flat scenery enables you to push on at your own pace. You’ll soon reach Suffolk again and cross the River Stour once more. A series of flat miles and pretty villages lie on the final straight between you and a finish",

    "description": "If you haven’t blown the winter cobwebs off your bike with a fast and free-flowing ride this far into the year, this April sportive set amongst the stunning South Downs of Sussex is likely just the event to ease you back into the saddle. Not forgetting this ride’s challenging hills, the Cycling Weekly Spring Sportive matches great climbs with the best descents that sprawl through stunning open country lanes. Kicking off in pretty Plumpton, the route heads east on unassuming back roads that can be taken at speed if so desired. As much as the hills on this route are a welcome challenge, you’ll be out of your saddle and counting on every last bit of winter training you have for the toughest ascents. Flirting with the most infamous hills in the area, riders are taken around the base of some fearsome climbs but the route tends to stick to luxurious rolling roads tucked away from traffic. Exploring East Sussex, sleepy villages are taken in one by one before reaching the outskirts of Heathfield – but this ride stays true to its countryside routes as it soon reaches back into the wilderness. Taking in a loop out past Five Ashes and back past High Hurstwood, you’ll be taken past Buxted and towards Uckfield on roads that remain mostly flat, quiet and long ranging. The route then leads north before crossing back into Mid-Sussex and turning south just before it crosses the River Ouse. A shining sun and helpful tailwind are enough to push you along for one last boost towards the finish line – which finishes on a mostly downward slope. You’ll cross the finish line feeling enthralled",

In addition to this, from 2011 we also offered a shorter Lite version of the Emitremmus. This event has grown to a point where we now have well over 400 entrants each year to this event and because of this, we encourage everyone to enter as early as possible to guarantee a place. Event Information We offer two different distances for this event. Both routes start and finish on the same roads but the middle follows different routes.",
