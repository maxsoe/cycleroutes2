Short riders peel off west while Standard and Epic participants bear south to our second AONB of the day, the Forest of Bowland, where the course centres its loop for much of the rest of the ride, while also bringing about one of the toughest challenges in the Trough of Bowland.Winding its way through the surrounding fells and rivers, the course gives some of the best views the area has to offer. Reaching Dunsop Bridge the course splits for the last time as Standard riders head west and Epic entrants continue south for an additional 1,500ft of climbing. Reaching the edge of Clitheroe, the sportive heads north, climbing up to the top of the Newton Fells before descending to continue onto Slaidburn. The return leg across the Forest of Bowland climbs higher than before, granting you glorious views of the Tatham Fells until you reach High Bentham, at which point the route heads east through the village of Hornby. Leaving the National Park at Gressingham, the route continues to wind its way north for the final miles until reaching the finish line",
